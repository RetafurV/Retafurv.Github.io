    <h3>Subjects of Study</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify ">At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like
        to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol style="text-align: justify ">
        <li>Turning H<sup>2</sup>O into wine, and the health benefits of Restorative (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>> 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</il>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores. </il>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify ">So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify ">Yes,you right! As part of my post -doctorate work,I did study tribal dances.To answer your question. my favourite dances are as follows ,with definitions:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1em">Polynesiam chicken dance
        <ol>At litle known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around in a cirele like chickens,encourage ther livestock or be "fruitfull "</ol>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <ol>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm ,they used to practice this dance,which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor ,and shuffing their bodies around in imperceptably tiny,very rapid movements.One
            of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired moden styles such as Twerking</ol>
        Artic robot dance
        <ol>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers int the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style charcaterised by "robotic " ,stited movements ,being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on
            however it was discovered that were just moving like this because they were really cold.</ol>
    </p>

    <p>Yurs sincerely.</p>
